## 🎮 What's Inside This Vault?

This is the **`.github`** repo for the entire ChecKMarK DevTools organization — shared workflows, reusable agents, CODEOWNERS, and whatever else belongs here.

```
agents/                  ← Org-wide GitHub Copilot agents
└── hlbpa-docs.agent.md  ← Documentation reader extraordinaire
```

> *"One does not simply organize their GitHub org without at least 47% unnecessary flair."*

## 🎨 The Brand

**Colors:** `#9d4edd` `#7209b7` `#560bad` `#3a0ca3` `#00d4ff` `#ff006e`

**Vibe:** Nature steampunk meets high-tech wizardry — flowers growing through circuit boards, neon glowing everything, zero corporate energy.

### 🔧 Developer Tools

**[rai-lint](https://github.com/ChecKMarKDevTools/rai-lint)** `Node + Python` 🔒

**[checkmark-icons](https://github.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons)** `HTML`

## 💫 Philosophy

Every repo is built on three principles:
1. **Make it work** — functionality first, always
2. **Make it pretty** — life's too short for ugly code
3. **Make it ridiculous** — if you're not having fun, what's the point?

**Built with robots, caffeine, a touch of chaos, and very questionable life choices** 🦾☕️🌀🤷‍♀️
